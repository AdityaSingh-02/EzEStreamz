This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

- Create a new .env file and copy content of .sample.env > .env file.
- Create a new project in [Appwrite](https://cloud.appwrite.io/) , get the API key and paste in .env file
- Install all the dependencies and get started with npm run dev, create account and check whether appwrite service is working or not.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Repository Structure

- When a user logs in successfully, they get the option to create a room as well as join a room by entering 12 digits unique RID, and by both ways, the user is redirected to /rooms/:rid, in the next js the folder would be named as room/[rid]

- To know more about the folder structure read the nextJs docs. All folder in "(this)" format are usually not accessible if not logged in. Hence in order to access secure content add appwrite service and then login.
